/*! # Actor model

The module provides an implementation of the [actor model](https://youtu.be/ELwEdb_pD0k) for the GMT Integrated Model.

Actors provide the functionalities for [client]s to exchange information and to update [client]s state, based on the data received from other [client]s through these [client]s own Actors.

An [Actor] is build first from a client, then outputs are added one by one and for each output a corresponding input is created that is added to another [Actor].
If the output and input rates of an [Actor] are not specified, they are set to 1.

A model will always have a least one [Actor] without inputs, the [Initiator], and one [Actor] without outputs, the [Terminator].

An [Actor] runs a loop inside a dedicated thread.
The loop starts waiting for new inputs, upon reception the client reads the inputs, update its state and write to the outputs.
The [Actor] will either send the outputs immediately into the buffer of the output/input channel or, if the buffer is full, it will wait until the buffer has been read by the receiving input.

An actor can simply be derived from a client with the [From](crate::Actor::from) trait.
Note that the client is consumed and no longer available.
```
use gmt_dos_actors::prelude::*;
let source: Initiator<_> = Signals::new(1, 100).into();
```
A name can be given to the Actor with:
```
use gmt_dos_actors::prelude::*;
let source: Initiator<_> = (Signals::new(1, 100), "My Signal").into();
```

If the client must remain available for later use, it must be wrapped inside a [Mutex] within an [Arc].
This can be easily done with the [into_arcx] method of the [ArcMutex] trait that has a blanket implementation for all type that implements the [Update] trait.
```
use gmt_dos_actors::prelude::*;
let logging = Logging::<f64>::default().into_arcx();
let sink = Terminator::<_>::new(logging.clone());
```
